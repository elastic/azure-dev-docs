#### [Ansible](#tab/ansible)

1. Save the following code as `delete_rg.yml`.

    ```yml
    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      tasks:
        - name: Deleting resource group - "{{ name }}"
          azure_rm_resourcegroup:
            name: "{{ name }}"
            state: absent
          register: rg
        - debug:
            var: rg
    ```

1. Run the playbook using the [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html) command. Replace the placeholder with the name of the resource group to be deleted. All resources within the resource group will be deleted.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook delete_rg.yml --extra-vars "name=<resource_group>"
    ```

    **Notes**:

    - Due to the `register` variable and `debug` section of the playbook, the results display when the command finishes.
    
#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Run [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az_group_delete) to delete the resource group. All resources within the resource group will be deleted.

    ```azurecli
    az group delete --name <resource_group>
    ```

1. Verify that the resource group was deleted by using [az group show](/cli/azure/group#az_group_show).

    ```azurecli
    az group show --name <resource_group>
    ```

#### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Run [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/Remove-AzResourceGroup) to delete the resource group. All resources within the resource group will be deleted.

    ```azurepowershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name <resource_group>
    ```

1. Verify that the resource group was deleted by using [Get-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/Get-AzResourceGroup).

    ```azurepowershell
    Get-AzResourceGroup -Name <resource_group>
    ```
