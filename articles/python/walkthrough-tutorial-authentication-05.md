# Part 5: Main app dependencies, import statements, and environment variables

[Previous part: Example main app implementation](walkthrough-tutorial-authentication-04.md)

This part examines the Python libraries brought into the main app and the environment variables required by the code. When deployed to Azure, you use application settings in Azure App Service to provide environment variables.

## Dependencies and import statements

The app code requires on a number of libraries: Flask, the standard HTTP requests library, and the Azure libraries for Active Directory ([azure.identity](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python)), Key Vault ([azure.keyvault.secrets](/python/api/overview/azure/keyvault-secrets-readme?view=azure-python)), and queue storage ([azure.storage.queue](/python/api/overview/azure/storage-queue-readme?view=azure-python)). These libraries are included in the app's *requirements.txt* file:

```txt
flask
requests
azure.identity
azure.keyvault.secrets
azure.storage.queue
```

When your deploy the app to Azure App Service, Azure automatically installs these requirements on the host server. When running locally, you install them in your environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

At the top of the code, then, are the required import statements for the parts we're using from libraries:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests, random, string, os
from datetime import datetime
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient
from azure.storage.queue import QueueClient
```

## Environment variables

The app code depends on four environment variables:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| THIRD_PARTY_API_ENDPOINT | The URL of the third-party API, such as `https://msdocs-api-example.azurewebsites.net/api/RandomNumber` described in [Part 3](walkthrough-tutorial-authentication-03.md). |
| KEY_VAULT_URL | The URL of the Azure Key Vault in which you've stored the access key for the third-party API. |
| THIRD_PARTY_API_SECRET_NAME | The name of the secret in Key Vault that contains the access key for the third-party API. |
| STORAGE_QUEUE_URL | The URL of an Azure Storage Queue that's been configured in Azure, such as `https://msdocsmainappexample.queue.core.windows.net/code-requests` (see [Part 4](walkthrough-tutorial-authentication-04.md)). Because the queue name is in included at the end of the URL, you don't see the name anywhere in the code. |

When running the locally, you create these variables within whatever command shell you're using. If you deploy the app to a virtual machine, you would create similar server-side variables.

When deploying to Azure App Service, however, you don't have access to the server itself. In this case, you create *application settings* with the same names, which then appear to the app as environment variables. 

The provisioning scripts create these settings using the Azure CLI command, [`az webapp config appsettings set`](/cli/azure/webapp/config/appsettings?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-config-appsettings-set). All four variables are set with a single command.

To create settings through the Azure portal, see [Configure an App Service app in the Azure portal](/azure/app-service/configure-common).
