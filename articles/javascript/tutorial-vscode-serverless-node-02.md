# Create the local Functions app

[Previous step: Introduction and prerequisites](tutorial-vscode-serverless-node-01.md)

In this step, you create a local Azure Functions application that contains a function that uses an [HTTP trigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node#http-triggers-and-bindings). An Azure Functions app can contain many Functions with [different triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings). The HTTP trigger specifically handles incoming HTTP traffic.

1. From a terminal or command prompt, run Visual Studio Code from within a suitable folder for the project:

    ```bash
    # Create and navigate to a project folder

    # Run VS Code in that folder
    code .
    ```

1. In VS Code, select the Azure logo to open the **Azure Functions** explorer, then select the **Create Project** command:

1. At the first two prompts, select the current folder, then select **JavaScript** for the language.

1. At the prompt, **Select a template for your project's first function**, select **HTTP Trigger**:

1. At the prompt, **Provide a function name**, enter **HttpExample**. (Avoid using the default "HttpTrigger" name because it's the same as the trigger, which can be confusing.)

1. At the prompt, **Authorization Level**, select **Anonymous**:

1. After a few moments, VS Code completes creation of the project. You have a folder named for the function, *HttpExample*, within which are three files:

    | Filename | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | *index.js* |  The source code that responds to the HTTP request. |
    | *function.json* | The [binding configuration](/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings) for the HTTP trigger. |
    | *sample.dat* | A placeholder data file to demonstrate that you can have other files in the folder. You can delete this file, if desired, as it's not used in this tutorial. |
