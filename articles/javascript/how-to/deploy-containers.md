# Use Azure to deploy, scale, and manage Node.js containers

Azure provides a robust container service so that you can easily deploy, scale, and manage container-based Node.js apps.

To get started, follow the simple step-by-step walkthrough [Deploy to Azure using Docker and Visual Studio Code](../tutorial-vscode-docker-node-01.md). Using Visual Studio Code makes it easy for you to upload images to a container registry (such as Azure Container Registry), and to then deploy that container to Azure App Service.

You can also go through the following Microsoft Learn modules:

- [Run Docker containers with Azure Container Instances](/learn/modules/run-docker-with-azure-container-instances/)

- [Build and store container images with Azure Container Registry](/learn/modules/build-and-store-container-images/)
