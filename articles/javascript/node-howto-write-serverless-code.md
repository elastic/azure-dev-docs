# Use Azure Functions to write serverless Node.js code on Azure

On Azure, the serverless offering is called Azure Functions. Serverless code allows you to create responsive, on-demand endpoints on the Internet without having to concern yourself with provisioning or managing infrastructure. Serverless code is composed of scripts or other bits of code that are run in response to various events. 

First, jump right in:

- [Create your first function using Visual Studio Code](/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code). This article introduces you to Azure Functions in the context of Visual Studio Code, which simplifies many of the details.

Next, expand your understanding of what Azure Functions can do by reviewing the following articles:

- [An Introduction to Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview), which describes the benefits of serverless development, costs, and the different triggers you can use to run serverless code.

- [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings)

- [Azure Functions developer guide](/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference) followed by the [Azure Functions JavaScript developer guide](/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node)

- If you're interested in writing *stateful* functions in a serverless environment, review [What are Durable Functions?](/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) as well as [Create your first durable function in JavaScript](/azure/azure-functions/durable/quickstart-js-vscode).

From here, you can enjoy a number other resources that help you explore serverless code further:

- Microsoft Learn Module: [Enable automatic updates in a web app using Azure functions and SignalR Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/automatic-update-of-a-webapp-using-azure-functions-and-signalr/)

- Learn about using various triggers to run serverless code:

  - [Run code when files are uploaded or updated in Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-upload-process-images?tabs=nodejsv10)
  - [Run code when a message is written into Azure Queue Storage](/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-storage-queue-triggered-function)

- [Store unstructured data using Azure Functions and Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/azure-functions/functions-integrate-store-unstructured-data-cosmosdb?tabs=javascript). For information on other databases, see [How to integrate Azure databases in Node.js code](node-howto-integrate-databases.md)
