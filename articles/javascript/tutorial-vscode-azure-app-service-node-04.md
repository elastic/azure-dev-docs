# Stream logs from Azure App Service

[Previous step: Deploy the website](tutorial-vscode-azure-app-service-node-03.md)

In this step, you learn how to view or "tail" any output that the running app generates through calls to `console.log`. This output appears in the **Output** window in Visual Studio Code.

1. In the **Azure App Service** explorer, right-click the app node and choose **Start Streaming Logs**.

1. When prompted, choose to enable logging and restart the application.

1. Once the app is restarted, the VS Code **Output** window opens with a connection to the log stream that shows output.

    Change the timeout with the App Setting SCM_LOGSTREAM_TIMEOUT (in seconds).

1. Refresh the web page a few times in the browser to see additional log output.
