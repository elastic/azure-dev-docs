Once you've installed the [Azure Storage extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage) in Visual Studio Code, sign into your Azure account by navigating to the **Azure** explorer, select **Sign in to Azure**, and follow the prompts.

After signing in, verify that the email address of your Azure account (or "Signed In") appears in the Status Bar and your subscription(s) appears in the **Azure** explorer:

> [!NOTE]
> If you see the error **"Cannot find subscription with name [subscription ID]"**, this may be because you are behind a proxy and unable to reach the Azure API. Configure `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables with your proxy information in your terminal:
>
> # [bash](#tab/bash)
>
> ```bash
> export HTTPS_PROXY=https://username:password@proxy:8080
> export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:8080
> ```
>
> # [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)
>
> ```powershell
> $env: HTTPS_PROXY = "https://username:password@proxy:8080"
> $env: HTTP_PROXY = "http://username:password@proxy:8080"
> ```
>
> # [Cmd](#tab/cmd)
>
> ```cmd
> set HTTPS_PROXY=https://username:password@proxy:8080
> set HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:8080
> ```
