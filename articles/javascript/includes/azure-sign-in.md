Once you've installed the Azure extension in VS Code, sign into your Azure account by navigating to the **Azure** explorer, select **Sign in to Azure**, and follow the prompts. (If you have multiple Azure extensions installed, select the one for the area in which you're working, such as App Service, Functions, etc.)

After signing in, verify that the email address of your Azure account (or "Signed In") appears in the Status Bar and your subscription(s) appears in the **Azure** explorer:

> [!NOTE]
> If you see the error **"Cannot find subscription with name [subscription ID]"**, this may be because you are behind a proxy and unable to reach the Azure API. Configure `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables with your proxy information in your terminal:
>
> # [bash](#tab/bash)
>
> ```bash
> export HTTPS_PROXY=https://username:password@proxy:8080
> export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:8080
> ```
>
> # [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)
>
> ```powershell
> $env: HTTPS_PROXY = "https://username:password@proxy:8080"
> $env: HTTP_PROXY = "http://username:password@proxy:8080"
> ```
>
> # [Cmd](#tab/cmd)
>
> ```cmd
> set HTTPS_PROXY=https://username:password@proxy:8080
> set HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:8080
> ```
