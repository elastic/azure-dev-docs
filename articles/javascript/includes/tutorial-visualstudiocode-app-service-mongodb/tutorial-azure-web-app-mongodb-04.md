This section of the tutorial add a local MongoDB database to your application using a Visual Studio Code extension and Docker containers.

## Configure Visual Studio Code to run containers

In this section, configure your development environment to run two containers, one for your Node.js project, and one for your MongoDB container. Because this section uses Visual Studio Code Dev Containers, the container configuration is saved in the **.devcontainer** folder. You can commit this to your source control so others on your team can also have access to a local MongoDB.  

1. In Visual Studio Code, use the Command Palette (CTRL+Shift+P) to select **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files**. 

1. Select **Node.js & Mongo DB** from the list.

1. In the **\.devcontainer\devcontainer.json** file, find the **forwardPorts** property, uncomment it and add `8080` to the array. If you also want access to access the MongoDB container with the shell, add the port `27017` to the array.

## Run web app locally with database

In this section, run your development environment with both containers, and view the web site. 

1. Select the green **Remote Containers** icon in the bottom-left corner of Visual Studio Code. This opens the Command Palette.

1. From the Command Palette, select **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**. The first time you open the project with containers, the Node.js and MongoDB images are pulled down and started. This may take a few minutes. 

    When the containers are running, the Visual Studio Code terminal displays the Node.js container's terminal. 

    Optionally, you can use the `ls` command to see your files. Notice your files are using a shared volume with your local computer. Changes you make inside the Node.js container to the code files are saved in your local files.

1. Start the project at the terminal with the following command:

    ```console
    npm start
    ```

1. Open a browser with your local web app URL:

    ```
    http://localhost:8080/
    ```

1. Enter data in the fields and submit the form. The data is displayed using the server-side React rendering.

1. When you're done exploring the app, stop the containers by using the Command Palette to select **Remote-Containers: Reopen Locally...**. This stops the containers but leaves them on your local computer. 

## Want to know more? 

Connect to the MongoDB container with a Visual Studio Code extension: **[MongoDB for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mongodb.mongodb-vscode)** to see your data.

If you would rather use the **mongo** shell, connect to the MongoDB container with a Visual Studio Code terminal by opening a new Visual Studio Code window, then using the **Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container...**, then select the container ending in `-db`. Once the window is attached to the container, open a Visual Studio Code terminal. You can immediately access the Mongo shell using the following command:

```console
mongo
```

When you want to clean up your containers, use the Visual Studio Code extension, **[Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)**.
