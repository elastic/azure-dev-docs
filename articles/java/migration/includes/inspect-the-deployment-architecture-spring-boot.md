### Inspect the deployment architecture

#### Document hardware requirements for each service

Document the following information for your Spring Boot application:

* The number of instances running.
* The number of CPUs allocated to each instance.
* The amount of RAM allocated to each instance.

#### Document geo-replication/distribution

Determine whether your Spring Boot application instances are currently distributed among several regions or data centers. Document the uptime requirements/SLA for the applications you're migrating.
