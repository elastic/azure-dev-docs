### Validate that the supported Java version works correctly

Using WildFly on Azure Kubernetes Service requires a specific version of Java, so you'll need to confirm that your application runs correctly using that supported version.

[!INCLUDE [note-obtain-your-current-java-version](note-obtain-your-current-java-version.md)]

See [Requirements](http://docs.wildfly.org/19/Getting_Started_Guide.html#requirements) for guidance on what version to use to run WildFly.
