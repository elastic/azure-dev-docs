### Determine whether your application relies on scheduled jobs

Scheduled jobs, such as Quartz Scheduler tasks or Unix cron jobs, should NOT be used with Azure Kubernetes Service. Azure Kubernetes Service will not prevent you from deploying an application containing scheduled tasks internally. However, if your application is scaled out, the same scheduled job may run more than once per scheduled period. This situation can lead to unintended consequences.

To execute scheduled jobs on your AKS cluster, define Kubernetes CronJobs as needed. For more information, see [Running Automated Tasks with a CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/).
