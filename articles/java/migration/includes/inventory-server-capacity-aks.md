### Inventory server capacity

Document the hardware (memory, CPU, disk) of the current production server(s) as well as the average and peak request counts and resource utilization. You'll need this information regardless of the migration path you choose. It is useful, for example, to help guide selection of the size of the VMs in your node pool, the amount of memory to be used by the container, and how many CPU shares the container would need.
