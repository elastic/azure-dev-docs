## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't have one, [get a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) or [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). We recommend Azure Cloud Shell so you'll be logged in automatically and have access to all the tools you'll need.
- A supported [Java Development Kit](../../fundamentals/java-jdk-long-term-support.md), version 8 (included in Azure Cloud Shell).
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) or a similar HTTP utility to test functionality.
